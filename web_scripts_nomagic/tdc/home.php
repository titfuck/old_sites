<h2>Welcome to the Theta Deuteron Website</h2>
<p>To the MIT Class of 2014:</p>
<p>Not too long ago, I was a freshman going through Rush. I went from place to place, checking out each fraternity, meeting all the brothers and seeing all the houses. I walked by Theta Delta Chi because I had hung out around there during CPW. I knew who they were, and I wasn’t sure it was the place for me. I met a handful of people who I clicked with, both freshmen and brothers. But there were over two dozen fraternities, and, at that point, I had only seen five. I wasn’t about to make a snap decision.</p>
<p>After walking around, eating a meal at this fraternity and going to paintball with that one, it had come time to start to seriously think about my decision. I had liked a lot of the places; after all, I had everything I wanted thrown at me once I crossed a house’s threshold, but I could only really see myself living at one place, at TDC.</p>
<p>So I decided to pledge, and two years later, my brothers have become my second family. I trust them wholeheartedly, and I know I can always depend on them. I encourage you to take the same steps to find a brotherhood that you can call your family. If that place is TDC, we will all welcome you as our brother.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
