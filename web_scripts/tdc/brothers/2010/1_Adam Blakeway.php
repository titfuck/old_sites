    <p>If Albert was a cake, Adam would eat him with Dominos’ Cinnasticks and a 2 liter of Fanta.  Then he’d pwn fried n00bs in Halo.  After which he would never stop talking about how Maine is the #1 supplier of toothpicks.  You’d think he use that Architecture know-how of his to build some toothpick model...</p>
    <p>In all honest, if you’ve seen V for Vendetta, then you know what a man is like who is charming, articulate, and courageous.  The protagonist in that movie reminds many people in TDC of one very familiar person.  That person is Pierce Brosnan.  Not Blakeway, he’s just a schmuck.</p>
