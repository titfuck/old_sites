    <p>It’s not hard for Kevin Kelley to look down his nose at you.  As a matter of fact, with being a 6’+ giant, it’s hard for him not to.</p>
    <p>Kevin is so many things, it is sometimes easier to say what he is not.  First off, he is not hispanic (according to the latest paternity test).  Kevin Kelley does not rob money from old women (settled out of court October 2004).  And Kevin Kelley is not an OG (obviously not original and definitely not a gangster - just look at the pics).</p>
    <p>This is what Kevin is:  a five o’clock shadow sporting behemoth that treats computer science classes like the girly men that they are.  It was once rumored that 6.001 wouldn’t come out of its room for a month after Kevin handed in a project.</p>
