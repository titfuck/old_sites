    <p>Circular motion for me, circular motion for me. Armand has a name that sounds French but he's really from Alaska. If you ask him why, he'll say that Alaska starts with an A and has the same number of letters in his name.</p>

Armand just loves to move. Sometimes, he'll go over to a bee farm and snatch a sack of bees and then stick them in his clothes and then start to move funny but then start his patented bee dance (copyrighted in three languages, including Braile). He perfects his bee dance and then struts into the club dance floor and does a tap rendition of Flight of the Bumble Bee with dance moves. Oh scheibenfenster!</p>
