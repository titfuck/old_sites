<p>Levon is a rabbinical pirate on his ship, the SS Skinwalker. He has traveled to the caves of the mystic wolves and has conquered the trolls in the forest of clawing shrew and now there's nothing Levon can't do! When not cruising on his big, blue, belligerently bruising battleship, Levon likes to use his sorcery of Mechanical Engineering to engineer himself a complete enigma of engines, the likes of which can power your cheap foreign car with the force of 5,000 McDonalds wind-up cars; enough energy to travel from Earth to Jupiter and back again approx. 2.3 times! "WTF, if we're traveling back and forth and end up in the same spot then we just had zero displacement," says the proud Levon, who's name in the French means "The Von." As in Von's supermarket.</p>
