    <p>Sometimes when Manny tells people he is from the island of Saipan, they look into the abyss and wonder.  They see a young barefooted boy collecting firewood on the shore and returning to the family hut where the father is outside trimming his kill and mother is inside making his siblings clothing.  After Manny informs them that Saipan actually has running water and a stable government, they usually just pat him on the head and keep moving.</p>

<p>If they actually stick around, they might fight out that this course&nbsp;1er likes dancing as much as he likes Britney Spears - because he’s one of the few that thinks she’s talented.</p>
