<h2>Welcome to the Theta Deuteron Website</h2>
<p>To the MIT Class of 2014:</p>
<p>So, you’ve finally arrived at MIT.  I was in your shoes three years ago.  Not a clue what to do or what to expect from this new journey I was about to embark on.  After I realized how much MIT is a sensory overload, I decided to just relax and let things happen. Then Rush happened…and I had a ton of fun, met a lot of people (including a lot of my current friends), ate more than I ever have in my life, and decided to join a fraternity that allowed me to express my individuality while still respecting everyone else’s:  Theta Delta Chi.</p>
<p>At this point, all you may know about fraternities is what you saw during CPW and that they use Greek letters for their name (usually).  That’s fine.  Use Rush to visit as many fraternities as possible and as the week progresses, narrow down your list until you find the right house for you, whether it is TDC or not (we promise we’ll still be your friends).  Even if you are not initially interested in joining a fraternity, at least take advantage of all the opportunities that Rush has to offer:  free trips, lots of food, and a chance to meet a lot of people.</p>
<p>Browse through our website and see if TDC is a house that you are interested in.  Also, look through our rush schedule and check out all the great events we have planned.</p>
<p>The last piece of advice I have to give you is this:  have fun.  This week is truly unreal and you will never be able to do this much for so little (a grand total of zero dollars).  Good luck to all of you and I hope that you pass by our lovely riverfront mansion on MIT campus and say hello.</p>
<p>Take care and good luck,</p>
