<BR><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>TDC has sports.&nbsp; Directly
across the street from our house is the MIT boathouse, and on the other
side are the tennis courts and brand new lighted turf -- perfect for midnight
pickup soccer.&nbsp; Some of our brothers choose to play varsity sports,
and most play a mix of intramurals.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>We have varsity athletes
in <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/hwtaylor/mtfxc/mtfxc.html">Cross Country,
Indoor Track, and Outdoor Track</A>.&nbsp; We also have several brothers
on the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/soccer/www/index.html">MIT Men's Soccer</A>
team.&nbsp; A couple of guys have participated in <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/mitcrew/www/">crew</A>
and sailing at one time or another. To see more about varsity sports at
MIT you can go to the <A HREF="http://www.mit.edu/activities/athletics/home.html">MIT

<P><FONT FACE="arial,helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>Our Athletic Chair, Phil
Marfuta, puts together our intramural teams.&nbsp; IM's are great for competing
without the serious time commitment, and to get out on the field, play
on a team with your brothers, and feel house pride.&nbsp; Last winter Phil
saw our B-league basketball team all the way to the finals.&nbsp; Other
sports we played last year were soccer, tennis, ice hockey, table tennis,
pool, ultimate frisbee, and volleyball. To get a complete list of intramural
sports you can go to the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/imsports/www/">MIT
Intramural's Homepage</A>.</FONT></FONT>
