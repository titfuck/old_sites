							<b>One easy way to get to Nick's place:</b>
							<p> Take the Long Island Rail Road to the Babylon Station.  Tell
							us in advance,<br>
							and call when you get to the station. We can be there in 15-20
							min to<br>
							pick you up. </p>
							<p><b>From Eastern L.I. (Suffolk County):</b></p>
						</center>
						<p><b>From North Shore:</b> <br>
						Take L.I.E. or Northern State Parkway to Sagtikos Parkway South.
						This splits at Southern State Parkway - take the right hand (east)
						branch, marked &quot;To Robert Moses Parkway/Ocean Beaches.&quot; Take the
						second exit (less than 1/2 mi.), again for Robert Moses Pkwy South.
						Now follow South Shore directions, starting at (*).</p>
						<p><b>From South Shore:</b><br>
						Take Southern State or Sunrise Hwy to Robert Moses Parkway South.
						<br>
						(*) Stay on R.M. over the Great South Bay (the very long bridge)
						and over the drawbridge.  Immediately at the end of the drawbridge
						turn right onto Ocean Parkway East.  After a mile or two, take<br>
						the turnaround on the left marked &quot;Oak Beach.&quot; Take the first
						right (lessthan 1/4 mi.) into Oak Beach.  Follow General Directions
						below.</p>
						<center>
							<p><b>From Western L.I. (NYC or Nassau)</b>:</p>
						</center>
						<div align="left">
							<p>Go East on Grand Central Pkwy (which turns into Northern State),
							Northern State, or Southern State Pkwy to Meadowbrook Parkway
							South (or Wantagh Pkwy South of you are starting in Nassau). Take
							Meadowbrook or Wantagh all the way until the rotary around the
							&quot;Pencil&quot; at Jones Beach.  Don't pay any fees for entrance to Jones
							Beach - pass the booths on the left.  Once on the rotary, take
							the eastmost exit (straight around from the Meadowbrook, 3/4 circle
							from Wantagh) for Ocean Parkway East.  Go about 13 miles, then
							exit right at &quot;Oak Beach.&quot; Follow General Directions below.</p>

							<p><b>General Directions:</b></p>

						<div align="left">
							<p>You will be facing a large parking lot. Turn left and go about
							1/2 mi; you will come to a gate. Pull up, press the button on
							the console, and tell the nice lady thet you're &quot;going to the
							Max's house.&quot; Once through the gate, stay left and follow the
							winding road until you get to the top of a small hill (a sign
							says you are now on Larboard Ct.) We are the second house on the
							right, No. 48, grey, with a driveway of white stones (and lotsa
							cars).</p>

							<p><b>From Boston:</b></p>
						</center>
						<div align="left">
							<p>Take Mass Pike (I-90) East to I-84 West (Sturbridge). Take 84
							to Hartford and get on I-91 South.  Once out of Hartford, take
							the William Cross Parkway (Route 15) West.  This enters NY State
							about 60 miles later, and turns into the Huchinson River Parkway
							(South). Stay on the Hutch over the Whitestone Bridge (sorry -
							$3.50 toll!) and take the exit at the end of the bridge for  Cross
							Island Pkwy East (Eastern L.I.). After a mile or less, take the
							right exit for the Clearview Pkwy South. Take the clearview to
							Grand Central Pkwy East. Then follow Western L.I. Directions above.<br>
