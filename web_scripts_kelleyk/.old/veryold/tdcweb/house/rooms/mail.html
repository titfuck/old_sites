		<p>The central nexus of TDC.  All mail flows though this point.  Since it is also the the main lobby, a lot of people flow through this area as well.  Luckly, the open stairway is wide and padded to accomadate even the most surly of visitors.  If your wondering how to avoid the pain of freshman physics classes, just ask Arun about 8.01X and the friction of staircase handrails.
