		where he bounces his phat new rhymes off on Vikas. At night the
		door is locked. Did we mention that Jesse lives here? The hardwood
		floors of this triple allow for all night dance parties when the
		mood is right. The large windows overlooking the Charles assure
		that everyone outside knows whats goin' down.</FONT></P>
