		<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Currently the biggest single in the house, though you wouldn't
		know it from the drawing, the 2nd Ell is a safe haven for very
		large Canadian's. Well, just one really, Ollie. This room traditionally
		holds 2-3 people in its large area (including a huge loft). It's
		windows overlook the courtyard and the 2nd floor deck, allowing
		easy access to deck parties all year 'round.</FONT></P>
