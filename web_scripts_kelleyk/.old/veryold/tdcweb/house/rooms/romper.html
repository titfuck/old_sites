		<p>This hard-core room is full of hard-core computer gamer Noah-Lehman Haupt and his hard-core Computer setup.  He's got a Voodoo2, six  types of removeable media, and more gigs than you can shake a stick at.  The whirring of drives extracting could be heard throughout the night during the heady days of late May/early June.  Although the spectacular painting on the south wall has been deemed by Noah to be &quot;too feminine,&quot; Jake Kendall knew it was neccessary to lighten the mood.  This room's window provides endless enjoyment due to certain Bakerites curious methods of &quot;surfing&quot; the internet.<br>
