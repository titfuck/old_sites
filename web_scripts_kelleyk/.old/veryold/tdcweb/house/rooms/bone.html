		<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The Bone is currently a Mexican villa. The music is funny sounding,
		the walls are yellow stucco looking, and lots of people seem to
		speak Spanish inside. Phil and Rodrigo sleep here occasionally
		with their friends. This large room holds 2-3 people and the window
		seat allows for fun in the sun, as Patty K. will tell you.</FONT></P>
