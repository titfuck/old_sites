		<p>Glorified in Rolling Stone, The Pub contains all the features necessary for a sweet party: recently remodeled bar area, Pong and Foos tables, sound system, DJ booth, ample seating, humorous signs, and spill resistant floor.  It's good for parties of two to two hundred, with more room on call with the mobile weight-room wall, and overflow to the deck, and mail room.  A great place to celebrate any occasion, the room is always in use, but unless you want to be cruisin' for a brusin', don't let Nick E see you messing with his 1200's.
