		<p>This deck has such great potential, which unfortunately went largely unused during last term.  It's furnished, with a desk and couch, which is great for chilling away from the crowd during a deck party.  A large wooden structure (planter?) covers it and with the addition of some clear plastic sheeting, would serve as a retractable transparent roof, great for hanging out during the rain.  Definately an area to improve during work week.
