		<p>Due to the unflagging enthusiasm of Ian, foresight and resourcefulness of Orion,  volumnuous experience of Aseem, and Media Lab funding, this room has been transformed into a Neo-Culturalist icon, equally suited for both night and day.  A protest of the confines of the typical Urban Outfitted interior design, this room transcends genres from Dickensesque classroom to lizard lounge.  Extensive use of faux-brick paneling allows for a complementary wall vocabulary to be maintained alongside the rich backdrop of Post-Floyd distress.  Integration of utilitarian necessities such as a chalkboard are softened by the  nostalgic sketches of the driving force behind the cultural revolution, and displays of ethnically insipired humor.  All this combined with easy access to the Penthouse, a neccessity for any modern urban hipster.
