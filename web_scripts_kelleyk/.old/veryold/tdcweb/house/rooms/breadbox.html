		<p>A fugitive's residence.  Rich Sonneker hides out here with the help of his girlfriend Rathana's superior costuming abilities.  He's on the run from Micro Center and the RIAA after shamelessly defrauding them in a massive CD-R hardware and music scam.   As House Manager, he has done a stellat job of maintaing the room.  Over the last year, he managed to install an &quot;extra sensative&quot; fire detector for improved safety, start a revamping of the Breadbox Bed, which lowers from the ceiling at the push of a button, and occasionally control odors emanating from his pet mice.
