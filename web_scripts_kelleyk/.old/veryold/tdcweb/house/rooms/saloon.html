			<b><font size="5" color="blue">The Saloon</font></b></center>

		<p>Fat City.  19ft ceiling, an upper loft level with King-Size bunk beds, access to the Center Trip deck and a spectacular view of Boston from four bay windows.  When sized up against the Gig, the Saloon is a little bit wider and a little bit longer, and for those mornings you just can't make it down the ladder to the bathroom, there's a convienet window to the Roof Deck.  Tony, Brenden and Andrew all had a hard time getting up in the morning living in a room with seating for well over 20,  a killer stereo, three refrigerators and bottle openers built in to the table.
