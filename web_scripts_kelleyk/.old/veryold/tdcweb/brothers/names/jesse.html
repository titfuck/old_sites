							&quot;Insert beer in case of fire,&quot; reads the label on this spry youth, TDC's first in a long line of appointed fire hydrants. Hailing from a land where the humor is as sparse as the water and John Thomas is never safe when there's lighter fluid around, Jesse Geraci '98 of Katy, TX has adjusted well to life in the big city here on the East Coast. With an affinity for chemistry and a soft spot for scooby snacks our newest Harold has turned out to be one of the house's most cost effective partiers. Fortunately, getting by in his Mechanical Engineering major seems to pose less of a challenge to him than finding the missing lens of his party glasses - forcing him to play many an evening's game of pong with out the benefit of depth perception.<br>
