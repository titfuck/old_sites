							Orion Smith '99, a Political Science major, could suggest a few answers. Perhaps his little sister, er I mean girlfriend, got him the subscription for his birthday. Maybe his hippie parents back on Martha&#146;s Vineyard gave him a little too much loving. Or maybe when he got here his roomate, Ian, stole all of his razors. I think we all know what happened, though: the reverse vampires in conjunction with the Rand corporation somehow arranged for aliens to kidnap him and suck all of his motivation into an elixer which they plan to sell via infomercials for $19.95 late next year.<br>
