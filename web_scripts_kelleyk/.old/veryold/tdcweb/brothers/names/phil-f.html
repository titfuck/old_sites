							Making up more than his share of TDC&#146;s 13 solid feet of canook, Phil Frei '98 from Mexico City, Mexico has always held the honorable job of Wacky Hair Chairman. At six foot seven and a hundred and sixty pounds, Phil makes just about every one feel short and fat. But long legs and arms don't seem to hurt him on the crew team. In fact, he and the other 6 and 1/2 feet of canook, Oliver Roup, pulled to victory in the North American Championships for their age group their senior year in high school. Thanks to his Mechanical Engineering Media Lab UROP, Phil is spending his summer in the happening locale of downtown Cambridge, testing his &#147;hapticdevices&#148; on the fairer faction of the local nightlife.<br>
