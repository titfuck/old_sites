							This decibelly-challenged Baldwin brother, who hails from Westminster, VT, has been attracting hordes of devoted maidens from Boston to Rhode Island. When Bill Wallis '99 isn't tickling his keyboard for his Computer Science major or tickling a member of his harem in bed, he can be found quenching his mighty thirst in the Pub. His other hobbies include sleeping, dodging his responsiblities as Senior Executive, and hiding from his perpetually visiting mother. Why a home-grown American boy has a Japanese accent no one can fathom. Maybe it's related to his high intake of Oriental food and Asian women.<br>
