<P>&#9;Sometimes in the course of human events it becomes obligatory, indeed even necessary to fight for something you believe in. Sacrifices in times of this nature are commonplace, and sometimes essential - lest the very Core and Essence of one's own Dignity be placed in question. The human Spirit, on occasion, cannot be ignored, and previous priorities and commitments must take their proper place at the end of the queue so that one's very Soul may continue to exist. So that Justice is served and that Order is maintained.</P>
<P>What, pray tell, does the Soul, Dignity, Order, Justice or any of the like terms have to do with the lovely Roberta? A fair question. Certainly in the past Bagel Boy has been wont to show any sort of familiarity with such terms. But, Robert Lawrence, I remember the Bob of Old (who from now on shall be referred to with a capital "B" to distinguish from the current sorry excuse for the partier I used to know, whom we'll just call bob.) This Mr. bob, is your call for redemption. Save your Soul. Return to that which created you to prove once again that you have not forgotten it's life lessons. Think of it not as a heinous task, a stupid gesture of proof to the thankless undergrads who can't remember your past glory, but rather a cathartic pilgrimage. Let the brothers of Theta Delta Chi both past and present cleanse your Soul of your recent blasphemy. Consider it an annual baptism. Rejoice with us dear Brother bob, let us forgive you your sins. Don't let us down.</P>

<P>Subject: Slamming</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Just thought I'd pass on a little story that occurred here over the past weekend. So it's Saturday night, and we're headed to the bars, actually one bar in particular, Grandma's. I'm sure I could come up with a better name for a bar, but you don't argue with a place that serves $.25 beers for an hour on a Sat. night. Anyway, this particular Sat. happened to be the climax of a four day long Oktoberfest celebration/Slamming competition. The way it worked was 3 times a night from Wed. through Sat. they had eight man individual slam offs, the winner from each group of eight advancing to the end of the night, and the winners from each night against each other on Sat. at midnight.</P>
<P>&#9;Well my friends had seen me slam for exhibition (I had kinda decided that my competitive days were over), and peer pressured me. You know how I can be susceptible to that sort of thing. The first round put me up against seven guys from a bachelor party - real football looking Big 10 frat boy types. I had slammed terribly - it was from a real glass filled to the top and timed tank-style only we had to be standing up with our hands at our sides to start, I only managed a 2.75. But it was good enough to beat the nearest competitor, who narrowly missed victory with a 4.5. (Hurst: I tried to make him slam another, but I guess our rules aren't valid here.) Anyway I won the next round and was hanging out, when a guy who just walked in came up to me and pointed at my hand and held his hand up. It took me awhile to figure out he was referring to my Brass Rat, and he had one also. Turns out he was a Theta Chi class of '91. He says:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;"So I was thinking about entering this competition, I used to slam in the Tank competition at MIT."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;"Yeah, so did I, I think I remember slamming at your house actually."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;"Oh really, what house?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;"TDC"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;"Oh shit, I remember YOU guys, if you were on their team, I won't even bother. You guys were out of control. I remember this Asian guy.."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;So anyway, I ended up winning the contest, significantly improving my time in the finals (around 1.8 or 1.9). I won a big drinking boot and a few German mugs and a t-shirt. I understand Tank is a dead art form in the house now, probably replaced by Bong or some other competition, but I believe it was a good thing. In its day, it was probably the most attended varsity sport on campus (no joke - Tank used to fill houses like a huge party) But enough of my whining. If you're interested in a refresher course Dang, Hurst or Joe - I'll be in town for lessons in a couple of weeks. Koob? Nah, probably not. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Okay, now i dont read my e-mail that often, and i have realized that there are a lot of letters being written by the alumns. Now, i dont really care what Chuck, Opie, or the rest of the house thinks of me, but i feel that there have been a few , shall we say, over-exaggerations that have slipped through. I havent read my e-mail since i wrote that (rather funny) letter to chuck, so im not sure exactly which messages i am quoting from, but i am sure you have received them. You can check the accuracy of the quotes, but you have probably already (wisely) erased them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Onto the point:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Nicole is the hottest piece of ass to ever enter TDC." - chuck</P>
<P>&#9;Now, i have been more than outspoken in my attitude toward Nicole, but</P>
<P>&#9;ill let the house decide on this one.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Those weren't genital warts on Carol's arm, they were 'fire ants'"- Opie</P>
<P>&#9;Yeah, sure Opie. All i got to say is that is that is it coincidental</P>
<P>&#9;that Bejarano also had genital warts at the same time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"I am the heaviest drinker, make that all around partier, im our class, as</P>
<P>an alumn, and much more hard core than the undergrads now." - Chuck</P>
<P>&#9;Thats just ridiculous. Chuck was always a weak partier, no matter</P>
<P>&#9;who he compares himself to. To hear him say this, at 3,000 miles</P>
<P>&#9;distance, where i could not prove him wrong, just outraged me. I hope</P>
<P>&#9;others are as offended as i am.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"The undergrads fear me when i come over, thats how much i terrorize the</P>
<P>young ones." - Chuck.</P>
<P>&#9;Yeah, sure.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Bubbles wanted me more than anyone in the house. But i had Nicole in Egypt,</P>
<P>so i had to say no. but i was cool about it, i let Cashman have her. Hes a</P>
<P>good grab anyway." - Chuck</P>
<P>&#9;Really chuck, i heard Bubbles have a gushy dream about you at night,</P>
<P>&#9;the only thing is that she was saying "harder cashman, harder".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"... Blue chip drinkers like Chuck and me" - Opie</P>
<P>&#9;Just like IBM, huh, Opathetic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Here are a couple other things that have been said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Your ass reminds me of Carol's mouth" - Opie to Chuck</P>
<P>&#9;It must be really awesome getting blow-jobs from shit-mouth, i mean</P>
<P>&#9;Carol, huh? (No offense Carol, Opie said it!)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Is it okay to have wet dreams about screwing a pledge?" - Chuck</P>
<P>&#9;Yeah, really chuck, its okay. Its very normal that you consider </P>
<P>&#9;Viktor a "Hunk of Russian Love". Boy, im really jealous that you</P>
<P>&#9;didnt have those dreams about me when we lived together. Or maybe you</P>
<P>&#9;did, and that was why you climbed up into my bed naked. You wanted</P>
<P>&#9;me, not the girl i was with.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"I love you Oprah, uhhh, I mean Opie" - Carol</P>
<P>&#9;Next on Oprah: Dykes who fantasize about me when making love to their</P>
<P>&#9;boyfriends.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If i didnt have carol, not many other brothers would have gotten pussy?" - Opie</P>
<P>&#9;Sure, opie, you verse BG would have been a great match to watch.</P>
<P>&#9;(no offense BG)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"I dont care whether others think it is disgusting to cum in your hand and</P>
<P>swallow it, i thought it was kinda kinky." - Chuck</P>
<P>&#9;All ive got to say is this: Chuck, you are a first hand lesson to</P>
<P>&#9;all people that its better to have a hobby in high school other than</P>
<P>&#9;wacking off.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"I have vast power, i will ruin you." -Chuck or Opie</P>
<P>&#9;Now, i dont know how they did it, i guess my first letter about chuck</P>
<P>&#9;being a nerd was accurate. However, i have better things to do than</P>
<P>&#9;figure out how to send messages to people in my name. Congrats chuck,</P>
<P>&#9;you figured out some new xmh commands. Party hard tonight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Im not as weak as you say, im stronger than Goober, I mean Koober" - Chuck</P>
<P>&#9;Well, last i saw, it probably would be a good competition.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Heres a funny story that reminds me of Whitebread ...." - Opie</P>
<P>&#9;Maybe that nerd letter about chuck should have included you as well</P>
<P>&#9;Opie. Maybe if Whitebread were to write a letter about your sex life,</P>
<P>&#9;it would go like:</P>
<P>&#9;Opie: "Hi Carol, would you like to have sex with me?"</P>
<P>&#9;(silence)</P>
<P>&#9;Opie: "Will everyone please leave the room!"</P>
<P>&#9;(A groaning sound is heard)</P>
<P>&#9;Opie proceeds to Wack-Off and then rejoin the party.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"You know Bob, no one really liked you and Nerd. You were like clowns, </P>
<P>everyone would go in your room, then laugh, and then leave. Especially</P>
<P>at Nerd, what a bozo." - Chuck</P>
<P>&#9;Thats real cool Chuck, harp on Nerd while youre 3000 miles away. </P>
<P>&#9;Why dont you leave him out of this, hes not doing anything, except</P>
<P>&#9;doing Lida, dreaming about Nicole... yeah, right.</P>

<P>It has come to my attention that there is a great word in the english dictionary that i did not know. I have had a reputation in the past of being a bit illiterate, but you can add this to my list of "big words". Others in this list include "picayune (phonetic spelling), itinerary, and other big words like those".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>there are two spellings (i figure)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"pabstmear" or "pabsmear" (pabst-smear): noun. 1) to obtain cells of the inner lining of the vagina to determine whether it is stinky or not. 2) A word used to threaten another human being, preferably another frat member. As in: "You faggot, pan, dont make me 'pabstmear' you!"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I learn something new everyday in grad school. The English language is pretty neat, i may start reading or something to learn more about it.</P>

<P>Geez, Bob, no wonder you did better than me on the verbal GRE's. I knew there was a word pabst-smear, but I thought it referred to drinking so much Pabst Blue Ribbon and getting so hammered that you lose control and take a dump in your underwear (a la Moxie), or maybe that's just a third definition.</P>

</B><P>How ironic it is that a MATHEMATICIAN will bring forth the soon to be most common used english word this century. OH, the Engliticians (those that study English) will be embarrassed (note - a big word there). Not only does pabstmear sound cool, it is politically correct. You dont believe me, well, you judge, which sounds better:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>a) I ate that pussy till it fell apart.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>b) I had some snatch-salad-sandwiches this morning.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>c) I ate her out like i would taco bell.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>or....</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>d) i gave my fine lady a "tongue-pabstmear" yesterday.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I thought so, d) is the correct choice. No longer will the radical feminists be able to say shit to me when i decide to vocalize. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You still dont see the significance of this? Another example, which is more correct:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1) Yo, sit on my face woman!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2) Why dont you let my nose-screw you. (interpretation -sit on my face)</P>

<P>3) would you please come here so i can more properly give you a </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is just no doubt about it. I will become famous. I accept this fame. It takes an English genius to see this stuff, and that i am.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Dear Mr. Englitician Wilson,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>first of all it is spelled Pap smear and not "pabstsmear". furthermore it is a diagnostic technique wherein the inner lining of the vagina is examined with a microscope for the early detection of cancer of the uterine cervix or the neck of the womb, not to see of the inner lining of the vagina is "stinky". (this technique was primarily developed by Dr. George Papanicolaou 1883-1962) also, your usage of the word is appalling since it does not follow the definition of the word Pap smear. i suggest in further correspondence that you are more precise in your usage . </P>

<P>This is something that happened that I totally forgot about but recently remembered. Chuck made me swear to secrecy, but that was four years ago, so fuck him. Do you know what I am talking about, Chuck? Does Zeta Psi ring a bell? How about stereo equipment? How about $500? </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyway, the story isn't all that exciting, but it's true. All parties involved have now graduated MIT, so I don't think any Zetes will be out to get Chuck. Anyway...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There were headlines in the Tech on how someone had stolen thousands of dollars worth of stereo equipment from 10-250, and there was a $500 reward. Chuck, Welch, Me, were playing cards, and the subject came up. Welch mentioned that some Zeta Psi's had bragged to him how they heisted the speakers from 10-250. Anyway, we made a crank call to them pretending we were the Campus Police. Chuck was Sergeant O'Malley or something like that, and he talked to the President and said he would come by tomorrow, that there was something he had to discuss. Apparently, the guy shat bricks, and was scared to death, and covered himself very poorly. Anyway, we had our little giggle, and it was a Thursday night and Zeta Psi used to throw a party every Thursday, so a bunch of us went over to drink some of their beer. Chuck was "not feeling up to it". This was typical. He rarely went to Keg parties because the Kegs didn't have Tropical Breeze or Berry or any of that Wine Cooler shit. Nor did they have Bud Dry, the only beer Chuck would drink.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So anyhow, we're coming back from Zeta Psi inebriated, walking past the CP's, I look across the street, and there's my buddy Chuck. I yell out "CHUUUUUCK!!!" No response. He doesn't even turn his head. I yell, "CHUUUUUUCCKKK!!" Still no response. So I yell, "Hey You Curly Haired Faggot!!!" No answer. Something was amiss.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The next day, when I saw him, I asked him, "Are you deaf? Didn't you hear me last night?" Chuck took me to his room where we were in private. Then he took off all his clothes... No, that's a different time... He made me swear to secrecy, which I did, but I figure 4 years is long enough, so here's what happened. After the rest of us left for Zeta Psi, Chuck thought about that $500 reward. Then he called the CP's and said he could tell them where the speakers were, but he would have to remain anonymous. The CP said he would wait outside for Chuck. Anyhow, as Chuck was walking to the Campus Police department, guess who was heading toward him, but a bunch of drunk TDC's coming from a Zeta Psi party, I presume some of us were wearing letters. So Chuck crossed the street, so the CP would not be able to put 2 and 2 together. So that's when I started my screaming to him. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyway, Chuck met the CP, who then said to him, "Hello, Chuck." So much for being anonymous. Anyway, Chuck told them about the Zetes. That night, the CP's got a call that the stereo equipment was in a dumpster or something. The equipment was recovered, and Chuck got the $500. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chuck had these points to add: </P>
<P>1) Focus a little more on my greediness. The reason I did it was because I wanted the $500, not because I wanted to squeal on the Zetes. You and everyone else who knows me knows that would have been the reason, but some who don't might think I was doing something moral. I'd hate them to think that. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2) There is a slight mistake in the last paragraph. The CP didn't say "Hello, Chuck." The man next to the CP, Neil Dorow, said "Hello, Chuck."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2) It would be nice if you could end with a happy note about how I spent the money- I bought textbooks, many pizzas, and those fruity wine coolers I love and I went on Spring Break to Florida for a whole week with Irmo, Opie, Pat, Ennis, etc. It seemed like a pretty good deal to me.</P>

<P>I wrote this a while ago... I forgot to send it to TDC:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nowwwwwwww...</P>
<P>Here's a little story I have to tell</P>
<P>About three bad brothers you know so well</P>
<P>It started way back in History</P>
<P>With Pickelhaupt, H-E-D, and the queer, OPIE!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Opie Had a butt-plug that he called Tovino</P>
<P>Just him, his butt-plug and some vaseline-o</P>
<P>Ridin' across the prairie, just like a fairy</P>
<P>Queer Nation chasing him because they like butts hairy</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One lonely fag Opie he is</P>
<P>All by himself so he can't plug his jizz</P>
<P>His hand is beating off on his little prick</P>
<P>His butthole's getting large, his buttplug will not stick</P>
<P>Looking for a homo, He met a necrophile.</P>
<P>His name was H-E-D, Op said "Toodles", HED just smiled</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hed told a little story that sounded like a joke</P>
<P>4 days on the run and that he's dying for a smoke</P>
<P>Opie's dick was in his hand, stale come was on his lip,</P>
<P>Hed's voice was dry and sobering and asked Opie to trip</P>
<P>Hed said can I get stoned? Op said "I'll get you boned"</P>
<P>Op had a chance to blow, Hed pulled out a dildo</P>
<P>Quick on the draw, Opie thought he'd get smeared</P>
<P>Hed put the dildo in Op's rear and whispered in his ear,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well, My name is H-E-D I got a bong and some Dope</P>
<P>I think you know what time it is, it's time to go smoke.</P>
<P>Now what do we have here? A dildo in a queer?</P>
<P>Let's smoke so much dope that we cannot see and cannot hear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hed pulled the dildo out, it smelled like shit, Op had a grin</P>
<P>You think the story's over but it's ready to begin.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>(There is a verse missing here)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now Hed said "Hey, I'm heading for the Tijuana"</P>
<P>The sherriff's after me for smoking all his marijuana</P>
<P>I smoked it like this,</P>
<P>I smoked it like that,</P>
<P>I smoked it through a wiffleball bat, so...</P>
<P>Now I'm out of cash, the cop's got my stash,</P>
<P>and right about now it's time to smoke some hash.</P>
<P>The Fag Opie, that's how I'm known</P>
<P>and I know the gay bars where I get the big bone</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They toked on all the dope until they were all out of pot</P>
<P>Op thought that HED looked cute and he was gettin' really hot</P>
<P>This dude was starin like he knows who they are</P>
<P>They took the empty spot next to him at the bar</P>
<P>HED said "Hey Op, you know this kid"</P>
<P>Opie said he didn't but his butthole did.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The kid said... Get ready, cause this is kinda nuts,</P>
<P>My name is Pickelhaupt and I'm gonna get butts.</P>
<P>Pulled out his Penis and stroked it really fast</P>
<P>He yelled, "Check it out!" and stuck it up his ass!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Heads went up, people hit the floor.</P>
<P>Chuck stuck in further and he moaned out "More!!"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm Pickelhaupt and I get called Chuck!</P>
<P>My ass or your ass is what I plan to fuck!</P>
<P>Opie was with it, 'cuz he's Chuck's bitch,</P>
<P>so he spread his cheeks wide and let Chuck satisfy his itch</P>
<P>Chuck is out, but Op can't be stopped.</P>
<P>He helps Pat to get his butt-cherry popped</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chuck got the HUNK pornos</P>
<P>Hed Grabbed the Mad Dog</P>

<P>So im just saying, sounds like the house is kinda havin some party trouble, huh? I mean, i hear theres an "alumni pledge", and NERD made him run away, he must be a real tough guy, ill make sure to get him a wine cooler or two so he can drink with us when we get there. Then again, maybe chuck will scare him away when he drinks "wild punch" flavor instead of original.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And Chaw, maybe we can sit around and talk about your upcoming wedding and all that cool stuff. OH .... sorry, im probably shouldn't offend the seniors, huh, seeing that they are the role models of alumni pledge, and the leaders of the house. Would kinda look bad if we made fun of your class. Oh Ryan, i heard you wacked-off DIng Dong when there was a girl that was right there that would do it for both of you. Your Class is sneaky, the real partiers would get drunk, then your class would come in and try to pick us up. Just so you know, younger ones, thats Baloo's ass, not just a fat girl. Why would they laugh in house meeting cause you did a fat girl?? Get smart, tough guy, theres an inside joke on you.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Im not trying to start anything, i mean, were supposed to get dressed up in ties and shit, you know, we changed the style of the banquet so people wouldnt drink, right? Why would i start shit with 45 girls, or men, or pledges, or whatever you guys now call yourself. Im just saying, chuck, nerd, and me will put under first 1) alumni pledge (from here on out TOUGH GUY) and second 2) the whole damn house. We wont even need Bersekas's Herculean (phonetic spelling) Phi Kap strength, although im sure hell help us also. Just want you to know, im real worried about the trip, i mean, i heard that Viktor wanted to redo the pub with pink daisies, im not saying anything about YOU, Viktor, but your a FAG. I beat you in every drinking contest we had, and i dont even have to physically remember, cause so many people saw it. People you didnt even know yet knew you were a loser. Well, at least youll be outta the house in two years, so you wont have to live with it for the rest of your life, unless i keep seeing you. Yeah, i expect a really jolly time. Heh, dont worry, i dont drink that much anymore anyway, so its okay if thats not what you guys are into anymore. hell, who am i to judge or make accusations. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyway, Keep doing your job TOUGH GUY, you got us alumni Reallllllyyyyy worried, im serious.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I need to take a trip to space, but i dont know if you guys go there anymore, I heard Bejarano is using his assortment of dildos to show correct form on Blow Jobs, probably not a bad idea seeing that you have the class of '95 and the rest of you guys will probably end up in jail after some of us alumni do something illegal in TDC's name. Dont forget, House officers can get arrested if the house does something wrong. Gotta wonder if alumni count as the "house".I think so.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyway, see you guys there</P>

<P>Hi bob. Just wanted to drop you line and say thanks for keeping in touch with all the various TDC news. Just so you know, TDC is a friendly place now that some of its more "barbaric" elements have gone. We like to nurture our relationships here, in order to create special bonds between us. That's why I would like to sincerely welcome you to join the in-house brothers for some quality social awareness enhancement after the banquet. I think it would be really cool if we all hung around together just enjoying our company. We could even give each other gifts or something. By the way, we don't make anyone drink here now. We do encourage a lot of hugging and self-affirmation, though. So you don't have any worries about expending to much energy out- drinking us. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Face it, shit for brains. Miles' wife could destroy your puny ass in half an hour. I've heard you talk this shit for three fucking years. So far, it's DC 3, Bob 0. Or as some shithead guy I don't even remember would put it, "Bagel point Bagel". So listen Bagel point Bagel boy, your record sucks just like your mom. I will undoubtedly enjoy watching you pass out in a pool of your own worthlessness. I think I may invite some friends over to see, too. "hey look at that loser passed out naked with a keg up his ass." "Yeah, I heard he sucks dick for drug money." You do don't you, bobby. &#9;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It's really nice that all those cool people at swiss-steak are letting you visit us. I hope your covered when on leave from work. Cause it would really suck if something happened to you and you weren't covered. Not that anything would, like say, you waking up duct-taped under the Harvard Bridge with a keg shoved up your ass and a big sign around your head that said, " I have no penis. Make fun of me and beat me up." But that would never happen to you, cause you're smart bobby, real smart. Like a fox.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So anyway, loser, bring it on. I will personally see to it that you get plenty of attention while you're hear. In fact, several of us will probably do our best to make sure that you have a really lovely time. By the way, the spot on the end of the bar by the taps is now a "handicapped drinking" space. If anyone but you is in that spot, you can tell them to leave, cause it is your right. Anyway, I have to go spend some quality time with baloo creating a "thoughtful" and "supportive" environment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Later fag,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ryan</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>P.S. Just so you know, there is a riding pool on how long we think you</P>
<P>will last here. I've got you down for 30 minutes. If you want in, send me </P>
<P>five bucks. </P>

<P>Miles,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>   Several people on my basketball team, D25 from EAPS, have expressed annoyance that your team was drinking alcohol during last Monday's game, and some members of our department's other D-league team, who will be (presumably) playing you later this season, have said that they don't want to play against you guys if you've been drinking.  I've even been urged to report the drinking to the IM sports hierarchy.  However, since your team seemed like decent human beings, I've decided just to advise you to not drink during future games - SOMEONE is sure to complain eventually, and drinking makes the games potentially dangerous for everyone.</P>

<P>  My Dearest Miles,</P>
<P>        I was at the aforementioned game, at least I think I was at the game in question and while I am concerned about our DRINKING DURING THE GAME, the nice womyn who wrote about that potentially harmful indictment overlooked one fact.I am sure, as you should be, that we ARE NOT decent human beings and since we belong to a fraternity(666) we should be accorded no rights nor should any deference be made to our humanity.  We are animals, ingrates, social misfits, and racist, sexist sociopaths.  Someone should inform this poor womyn as to the realities of our existence so that she should never repeat the mistake of calling us, of all things, decent human beings.  If you like we could work on a creative yet pursuasive response to this kind womyn's concerns and email her as soon as possible.  We should also highlight the fact that drinking makes us happy and more sportsman like, whereas if we were sober we would care about the game and quite possibly injure some or all of the members of the opposing D-League teams.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Please write back to me as I am terribly concerned with the implications of her letter.</P>

<P>&#9;Hey Bob! This rhymes with passed out in the pub. You are getting me aggravated. You know you arer just a nerd in fucking california having sick fantasies about fat girls. Unfortunately they never come true or you would be flat by now. I bet you are actually fucking flat - no muscles and just a huge soft beer gut (probably soda gut 'cause you can't drink and never could. That message of yours sucks shit and just makes me fucking mad. When you come to the banquet I'll make you drink wheter you want to or not. I'll open you stinky mouth full of yellow unbrushed teeth and pour in wine until it will start leaking out of your skinny butt. It's time to put your books down, pull the gerbil out of your ass, take your skirt off and start slamming.</P>

<P>Subject: Neal Dorow is soooo cool. And who is Ni</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It's about 8:30 AM, and I've already been up for two hours, which gives you some sense of how sick and excessive life after college can be. Well, if you have a job. Hopefully within my class that will include more than myself and Art someday. Anyhow, my e-mail address here at work (202-2134@mcimail.com) has been added to the tdc mailing list so I can still get all the important news about what's going on, especially high priority stuff like this message from Neal Dorow. I'm glad he's using the mailing list "only for the most important information." Knowing Neal I was worried that he'd use the list to send out a lot of crap, but boy was I wrong. I just have a few questions, though:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Which retard gave Neal Dorow the real mailing list address? Was this foolishness by Dang or the a malicious act of a graduating senior by the Zags? Neal Dorow, in all honesty, would not have been able to guess tdc@mit.edu if no one had told him. Let me take a wild guess by the way: is tdc one of the houses taking "Jar Wars" less seriously? Did the house pass up the chance to buy Geek Week Ball Tickets at the low low bulk rate? Even more frightening -- are one or two pledges actually going? If so, are they the same ones who thought the Tower Court Mixer was a really great party?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I hope those last two aren't happening.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ummmm onto my main purpose -- which one of the pledges tried to call me last night about the Flag Room? Could you just E-mail me at 202-2134@mcimail.com instead of calling? I'm not usually easy to reach, and I have this fear you'll call well after my 10:30 bedtime. I expect to hear from you soon, but even before then there are some real easy things you should know about:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The fundaligionist logo, the Lock-Nar and where it came from, Greg broke that damn window in January of 1992 and I bet no ones fixed it yet, Seth -- "Break my bed", Geoff -- Oh no he's talking nice to us, Otis, Mid-air refueling, always take your LSD out of the freezer before the cops come (or else you'll have to see Neal Dorow again), the twenty foot bong -- a sign that your drug use may be excessive and noticeable, my bed, be wary of tripping people with too much paint on their hands. Those are the things that come to mind right off the bat. Write back with specific questions and things you already know.</P>

<P>&#9;Greetings from Stanford!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Yes, I am finally able to go to class without having to put my jacket and gloves on (not that I ever had gloves). Stanford is really cool and I am having great time. The weather is absolutely incredible - every morning I wake up and think it is going to rain or it is going to get really cold because weather like this usually does not last long. Fortunately it lasts long here.</P>
<P>&#9;I started my classes about a week ago. As Zags pointed out this is no undergrad - classes are pretty hard and most first year students in my department have Master's in some field. One girl, she is about 30 actually, has two Master's degrees. They kick ass and I am trying to make up for the difference as fast as I can. Fortunately I only have three classes, so it's not that bad.</P>
<P>&#9;I am working as a T.A. for this really easy introductory probability and statistics class. Every Friday there is a quiz and guess what, I am responsible for making up and administering these quizzes ( all the power I have now ). I also have office hours when students come and ask me stupid questions. I answer them the best I can but inside I laugh at them.</P>
<P>&#9;Another good thing about California is that they sell liquor in supermarkets here (even on Sunday). I got a supermarket coupon book and cut out coupons for Jim Beam and beer and also wine-in-the-pouch that we usually have at the semiformals after good wine (I should probably say better wine) runs out. Even without buying liquor there are plenty of ways to get drunk - every time there is some social function for grad students there is free food and free beer and I get trashed for free ( some grad students, especially Asians who just arrived from China and Taiwan even get scared when they see me do it ). Some people are actually pretty cool and we hang out together all the time, especially with people from my department.</P>
<P>&#9;If you want to contact me I still have e-mail at MIT and now at Stanford. My phone number is (415) 497-7029. If you are in the area drop by any time. I have a couch in my room and it has already been used by one TDC alum - Ryan. </P>
<P>&#9;Good luck to all of you and I'll see you in December.</P>

<P>Subject: Why Chen is An Imbecile</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chen's statement underlines his misconception of MIT. He implies that "shteaking" is "bad" and that as a result of such behavior one will end up like "the '95s". Indeed. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Point: Every American, Degree holding member of the class of 1995 is gainfully employed. Each is a credit to his profession, and none make their primary living by illegal means. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thus Chens thesis is refuted -- in fact the opposite is proven true. Four short years ago, as I was about to have my first sober evening at TDC since I'd pledged -- in fact, I believe it was this very day, 40 days after pledging, I was but at the beginning of a long saga of slack. And yet, when I emerged from the haze and vomit a few months ago I found myself the only employed member of my class. SInce then other slacker brothers have joined the working world, and now none are forced to suck dick for drug money. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Yes, sometimes the twisted road of life must take you out into the cold outdoors, away from your keg and pipe. And some nights you will have to sit under the harsh glare of your reading lamp, copying problem sets or cramming for tests away from the soft warm luminescence of the pub lights shimmering off the polyeurethane coated celebration of life and the human spirit that is the bar.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But as you sit there, take comfort from those have gone before you. Know that your efforts to experience the joy of life to its fullest, even if it means not remembering all the details or where those bruises came from, will some day lead to a profitable career in the profession of your choice. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Or work at your classes, and be a dork, and graduate, and go to school again, to work more, to be more of a dork, to some day graduate, and go to school again, to work hard, and be a dork, to graduate, and be a professor and live life surrounded by dorks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Don't be a dork. Get Drunk. Get a Job. Make more money to get more drunk.</P>
<P>Be all you can be.</P>

<P>Like any ALUM has anything to "beware" of from anyone there these days. Oh, I'm sure Dave Burt will be able to make it through a few beers before he wets himself, and John Bae may have a couple shots before he starts stumbling around all red-faced, but who else even drinks anymore? The sophomore class is real intimidating after that pathetic showing last year when all of you put together couldn't outdrink a few older people from the fourth floor. Maybe Phil the Alum-Killer will be back, that way we'll have someone to drink with for an hour or so.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Naturally, and as always, I'm sure there are several pledges reading this thinking 'Not me, I'm not a weak-livered pansy like those other guys I live with, I can drink'. Don't worry, this kind of stupidity is expected from you. But you're young, maybe someday you'll rise to mediocrity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Why do you think there's no open bar? Puppet Dang and the rest of exec/slack/com really tried to make it easy to avoid drinking by making people buy their own booze. Maybe you can warm up some milk and cookies for us when we get home from the hotel. We can sit around the formal room and sew a fucking quilt, or whatever it is you sober people do in your spare time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Make sure you call Blanchards early (the number is (or was) 782-5588, in case nobody remembers anymore), because you'll probably have to spend some time explaining where you live to them now that they don't deliver kegs to you every night, like they did when I was a pledge.</P>

<P>So, I guess the shit-talking festival is ready to commence. Gentlemen, start your engines because this message is almost to good to be true. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1.&#9;What the fuck are you teaching these pledges? I guess everyone in the house has become a colossal vagina. WHEN I WAS A PLEDGE, the brothers (and the alumni) would never let me send such a message without proper retribution. For instance, a bottle of Jack Daniels up my ass. In other wors Noah, them's</P>
<P>fightin' words.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2.&#9;All of this seems to mean that you, Noah, as well as some or all of your PLEDGE-mates think you're pretty hot shit. Well I beg to differ. I could change my mind though, like if your 160 pound frame could tolerate the abuse of 1 liter of whiskey in 3 and 1/2 hours. Actually, I seem to remember Bae drinking</P>
<P>30 shots of whiskey in that time period which is about 1.35 liters. This impresses me. "It's six in the morning and I'm going to send Ryan a poorly composed message filled with poor spelling that says I can drink more than you because I'm obviously wasted out of my mind and I'm too young and stupid to know any better" does not impress me. To sum up, sure I'm old, sure I'm weak. But I'm also not a pledge. I'm an alumni. To me this means that in some sense I've paid my dues and can therefore be happy with my weak state reveling past glories all the while. You on the other hand are going to drink a lot before</P>
<P>you can do that, so you might as well start now. I'll let you know when it's okay to stop......</P>

<P>&#9;Dear Gus you ignorant freshman fuck,</P>
<P>Those of us who have been using email for more than fifteen minutes have realized that chain letters often appear and are easily bred during electronic communication. Now I know that you are wise and sensible and will never send another chain letter anywhere near me. They are not amusing, new, interesting, or educational. If you send me another chain letter you will receive a mailing like this from me. </P>
<P>&#9;Dear Gus you ignorant, stupid, pea-brained, babyfood eating clueless, pimpstick, no life having, I'm so fucking cool-cuz-I'm-o n the information superhighway, geek, loser, couldn't get laid in a morgue nerd...etc. etc.</P>
<P>PLEASE PLEASE DON"T MAKE ME WRITE THIS LETTER IN FULL, IT WILL NOT BE FUN(AKA it will hurt me more than you). You should also keep in mind that you are a pledge and subject to a unique kind of stupidity(aka you are a second class citizen and second class citizens should be seen never heard). I will see you during alumni banquet and I'm sure you will drink me under the table like the man you are, but till then stay outta my inbox.</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Love and ITB,</P>

<P>I'll make this brief.</P>
<P>So far Noah and Gus have been the only ones to put up any real threats to the alumni. Is it just coincidence that Gus gets drunk the least of any of the pledges and Noah has the lowest tolerance? I think not. I have been silent so far because my reputation will speak for itself at the banquet. I am making it my mission to see that every pledge ends up hung over for at LEAST 2 days. Got that Geiger? I love all you guys but when the dust clears, I will not only be the last pledge standing, but the last person period. Got that Miles? Understand Ryan and Seth? You too Ed Adlerman, you all go down with me. I'll see you all bent over the toilet on the 18th.</P>

<P>Pledges I think you're missing the point...it's one thing to drink your ass off for one night but it's another thing to drink your ass off every night sure it's going to be fun drinking ten shots in an hour than passing out and calling it a night but it's another thing to do that every night...the nearest to this I've seen anyone come is the class of 95's who well how to put this nicely are for the most part alcoholics...Let me remind you pledges that the pub is open every night seven days a week...we don't just open it up for special occasions...come down hang out have a beer DURING the week it won't kill you....the brothers and alums this weekend will however kill you</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gus..my girlfriend has gotten drunk more times than you have this year and she's a fuckin weak ass chick for god's sake</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Noah..unless you can hold down six beers without stripping,pissing and then booting on yourself....keep your mouth shut no one's impressed with someone who after an hour in the pub is naked and moist(unless your a girl)..you have to be in the pub all night that's the point of drinking...getting fucked up and hanging out</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Rest of the Pledge Class....smart move keeping your mouth shut...also YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRINK TO BE IN THE PUB...if drinkings not your thing cool...no one is forcing you to drink and if they try to tell them to fuck off...and if it's one of those large drunk intimidating alums(LYLE) just laugh at them and they're pathetic little lives...remember the point of this weekend is not to piss yourself it's to meet alums, hang out &amp; have a good time</P>

<P>These have got to be the most hysterical pledges I've ever heard! Naturally, I hope that by Alumni Banquet poor Gussy will have his health back long enough to get vomiting drunk, and Owion will be thwough with his pewiod, and that pussy Noah won't go running to a computer as soon as he starts drinking (since that's been a trend I've noticed from his E-mail messages).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When I was a pledge, we didn't have time to talk shit to the deadwood - We were too busy drinking and smoking dope! By the time I even had an Athena account Alumni Banquet was over, and I'd already failed a test, and I was drunk for all of it. We didn't have time to send E-mail because the Athena terminals were up in the library, and by the time we got there our beers were empty so we had to turn around and go get more. Eventually we tried using pitchers, but by then our tolerances were high enough from drinking every possible moment that we just drank the pitchers. We tried carrying a keg, but since we kept stopping to do keg stands it was empty by the time we made it to the 4 th floor, and we had to go get another one.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You fucking pansies make me sick. It's just as my class feared when we graduated -- err.. left the house. No one left there has any real capacity to drink. I don't think people even like throwing up any more, and when you give up your love for your chunks, you lose all ability to drink.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Maybe we should have a nice little alumni campfire in back. We'll just sit around and roast marshmallows so nobody gets hurt trying to drink with the alums.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By the way, I hope someone has the foresight to go buy some beer pong balls. And some good paddles too. And if there isn't at least one paddle there with no handle, I'll just have to break one off when I arrive.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>See you this weekend. Why don't you go drink now; at least try to develop some tolerance.</P>

<P>Subject: The Value of Learning (ok, it's shit)</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I didn't learn much in college. And this used to worry me, because I thought to myself, "What if they want me to do something I don't know yet? Will I have to take extra time to learn everything I didn't pick up in school?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well, in case any of you are considering employment, let me relieve you of any such anxieties. First of all, if you already knew what you were doing, what would you do the first few weeks at work? You'd waste all that relaxing training time actually being productive. You'd cut your useful hours drastically by being so much more efficient. Then everyone would give you their shit-work too, because Hey! You are just so damn productive!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Not me pal, I avoided that trap, got trained in like a normal monkey. And get this, it gets better. Since I didn't learn how to do some stuff while I was in college, I'm getting time now to "study up." Yup, since there's nothing important left for me to do, rather than being reduced to some menial typing or filing task I'm being left to learn about some statistical thing on my own. And after that I've convinced them to give me time to learn C++, which they think is great for me, even though I claimed I already knew C on my resume (and transcript).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And you see, the real beauty of this is that instead of me paying them, the way you get stuck paying a University, they're paying me. And right now I'm not even working!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well, time to go back to reading, but I just thought I'd share my insights on corporate America while I was on company time.</P>

<P>spring break is different from the parties we have here at tdc all year around.</P>

<P>one can stay in boston to do numerous shots of rum or whiskey. only in bahamas, you can keep drinking bahama-mama until the vacation ends. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>our goal is not to pass out or puke as many times as possible. our ultimate objective in this bahama trip is to stay drunk as long as possible. this is the only way to attain true happiness in the place like bahamas. </P>

<P>Brothers -</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I hate to have to write this message, but my duties as an officer and a self- respecting brother of this house require me to explain exactly why there will be no food served today.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Last night, a brother left the message "eat a dick, Jerry" in slices of onion on Jerry's cutting board, and a mess on the counter next to it, there for Jerry to see first thing when he walked in this morning. I explained to him that there was no way we could expect him to serve us after one of us insulted him in this way, and he decided to stay until the food order was delivered, and then to go. The brother involved has since apologized to Jerry, and hope- fully we will be served tomorrow and in the future.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I don't know what other courses of action I have - I don't like to punish </P>
<P>everyone with no food for one person's actions, but when it comes to relations between Jerry and the house, between an employer and a professional employee, we act as one entity - and one person's actions (proper or not) reflect all of us.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If there are truly problems with Jerry, or any other facet of how the steward- ship or the rest of the house is run, I wish and hope that nobody here has any problem speaking to the officer or person in charge of whatever might be wrong. I don't want to belabor this any longer - suffice to say that I and the house have been embarrassed, and it should not happen again.</P>

<P>1. What is your purpose? (I know that sounds weird - It's just that I happen to know of several frats that have a definite purpose - e.g. Kappa Kappa Psi is music, Phi Beta Kappa is academics/engineering, etc. If your just a social group - that's fine too.)</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To get really high as often as possible, all under the guise of getting an education. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>
<P>2. What is the furniture like in the rooms? What is provided?</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Some type of wooden platform with a dirty mattress to sleep/puke/fuck on. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>
<P>3. Does each room have a separate Data/internet/athena phone line? Ethernet?</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Of course. All brothers must have full 24hrs/day access to alt.binaries.sex.female-anal for research purposes. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>
<P>4. Are any of the brothers in your fraternity Objectivists?</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>No, we don't deal with that philosophy crap. It's MIT you moron. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>
<P>5. What are the responsibilities of Freshman inductees?</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To try and get high, drunk, and laid while providing endless hours of entertainment for the rest of the brothers. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>
<P>6. Did I leave anything out?</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Of course. Like any outstanding fraternity, we uphold only the highest of social standards. Drinking fellow brother's urine is highly discouraged, as is sleeping with their girlfriends, getting naked at parties, and all other activities which propagate the highly exaggerated Animal House image. </P>

First, as far as taking responsibility for myself- I did clean the infamous shit when it happened. I cleaned the 4th single completely, and I steam vacuumed the hallway. This got most all of the physical remains, although I admit there were still stains that needed to be removed, and I should have emptied the steam vac. I was planning on using the steam vac this evening to do a more thorough job of cleaning up- so as far as Hurst "having to take responsibility for my drunk actions"- I didn't ask him to, nor did I want him to- and I was perfectly willing to do that stuff myself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>More importantly, as far as the house is concerned, is that Hurst is taking issue with me for doing dumb things when I'm drunk. Fine- it's true. I admit it, and I have been cutting down on how much I drink (last night being a notable exception). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But what the fuck- half the people in this house have done dumb, reckless, or disgusting things when they have had too much to drink. Just a few instances off the top of my head- </P>
<P>people pissing in my VCR,</P>
<P>pissing at the table at Alumni Banquet, </P>
<P>ripping the Lady's head sink out of the wall,</P>
<P>lighting people's clothes on fire, </P>
<P>throwing pool balls through Baker windows, </P>
<P>throwing things off the roof, </P>
<P>writing "Eat a dick, Jerry", </P>
<P>puking practically everywhere in this house, </P>
<P>trying to piss on other people, </P>
<P>jerking off in my room and then sticking the splooge on my window,</P>
<P>I even had a brother climb into my bed naked and try to butt fuck me. </P>
<P>And a lot of these dumb things were done on purpose. So Hurst, are you going to have a personal vendetta against all these people too? Should I hate the people who have done disgusting things to me?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Finally, Hurst, I think it's ludicrous that we're having this discussion via the house mailing list. For god's sake- the rest of the house shouldn't have to see that personal attack you laid into me with at the end of your email, nor does it help house spirit to have conflicts out in the open like this. If you want to seriously tell somebody off- fine, but don't do it on the house mailing list. Now hopefully this can all be forgotten.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dear Alumnus of Theta Deuteron,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>First of all, a warm hello from the Brothers and pledges at 372 Memorial Drive. We wish you well and hope that you've had a good summer. We'd like to bring you back to Cambridge to continue our annual alumni celebration. This year we will be catered by our own Chef of 6 years, Jerry Koizumi on November 2nd, 1996.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Translation: Alumni Banquet is back at the House! We're all getting shitty! Jerry's going to make the same Cordon Ala Butter he has for every formal for 6 years, but why should you care since you're just going to boot it up in a few minutes!]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The dinner will be at our House and will cost $35 per person. We will have a light cocktail hour preceding dinner and a leisurely evening to follow. We hope that you enjoy your stay and get a chance to catch up with your classmates while reminiscing your time at the House. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Translation: Alumni Banquet is back at the House! We're all getting shitty! And we're going to start getting shitty before we eat!]</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>During the weekend, we hope to play some softball (weather permitting) so bring your mitts and enthusiasm along. If you need help securing a place to stay, finding phone numbers of local alumni, or a hotel's phone number, please just get in touch with me, Camilo Cepeda, or our Senior Executive, Jungwan Bae. We will be happy to help you in any way possible.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>[Translation: OK, you could do something besides drink (but why?). And if you don't plan to pass out on the floor in your own juices somewhere, you might want to consider a hotel, you pussy.] </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We sincerely hope that all of you can make it to the banquet and look forward to hearing from you soon. You may RSVP by phone at (617) 494-8300 or 621-1369 x145. Likewise you may respond by email to tdc-alumnews@media.mit.edu.</P>

</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There has been some loose talk floating around the country...Talk that cuts right to the heart of several recent alums, and fills us with shame. The word on the street, the rumors that fill us with disgust on a daily basis, are that the house simply can no longer drink beer.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gone are the days when Tank was the single most popular event on campus and we were king. When I was a pledge, I would spent hours practicing, so as not to disappoint the Brotherhood when it came time to prove myself. Oh the punishment delivered to me by the Elders...Jin Oh, Micah, names that are not only barely recognized, but probably far up the back staircase by now.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well if we're having an alumni banquet...then god damnit I want a fucking pledge who can slam against me and not suck. I'm not asking for world records...but he should be able to beat Chuck. I want a house team to take on an Alumni team in Tank. If we lose, we'll buy the house 2 kegs. If we win, well you just have to live with the humiliation that comes with knowing that we're harder now, than you are at the so-called prime of your lives. I'm flying in for the weekend, I'm paying good money for the banquet...trying to recapture a bit of the good life. Is that too much to ask...ONE pledge who doesn't suck, who can honorably slam a beer, and an in-house tank. I'M MARRIED FOR CHRIST'S SAKE - and yet the house doesn't have anyone who can slam beer with me. Well youngster's, I'm asking you to show me up...slam a beer with Opie and boot on Roland (actually, that might be a fun game too, "Boot on the Ex-Presidents"). Please don't let me down...</P>

</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Alright little girls, I've heard all the Shit talking and it's making me wanna puke. Each day, when I stumble into work at 10 am and check my email, I'm sickened by all this Banquet "Shit-Talking." If it wasn't for my desire to keep the Early Times Whiskey down, I'm sure I would stain my shoes. When I lived at the house, not too long ago, I remember there were certain rules and regulations when people "talked shit." The most important of which was: "if you're gonna talk the talk, you'd better be ready and fucking able to walk the walk." I'm not trying to say that talking a mean game is wrong, I'm just trying to say that if you're going to do it, you'd better be ready to drink, vomit, dunk your balls in some gold bond, drink some more, dunk your balls in some vomit and drink some vomit. I remember once or twice I talked some shit, but you could be sure when I did, Jake, Jesse and Bae would be hittin' the floor in a puddle of there own bond-flavored piss before 11. Now, my score is not with those guys anymore, its with you punk-ass pledges. You may think that a little frosty feeling around the nads makes you a man. A strong-willed buck of a man, even. Well, kiddies, Uncle Danger (that's dayn-jur to you) wants you all to know about another little pledge. I don't suppose anyone has told you about (let's call him Nutsack to maintain his anonymity) Nutsack's story, because you're still so young and impressionable (read: Pussies), but I'm gonna tell you (sorry Param, the cat's out of the sack, now). </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well, Nutsack was the 18th pledge of the class of '96 (yes, that's the same Class of '96 you've learned to run from in terror), and he thought it would be really cool to talk some trash to the alums before Banquet. He's dead now.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For now, I'm just taking names. Patty-cakes and DickJob are 1 and 2 on my list. Any other takers? Just keep the names coming. I'm on a mission and it's not going to be pretty. When the clock strikes midnight and all you chumps are piled butt-naked to the pub ceiling, I'll be standin' over you with my nads soaking in some raspberry-flavored extra-strength gold bond medicated powder, hosting the First Annual Ricki Awards for Outstanding Penis Entertainment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What I'm trying to say here is: </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>DANGER IS COMING TO BANQUET AND YOU'RE GONNA BE FIRST HAND WITNESSES TO THE MOST PAINFUL PARTYING EXPERIENCE OF YOUR PUNY LITTLE EXISTENCES.</P>

<P>Pablito, I have some difficulty understanding your words; perhaps your typing is effected by the Gold Bond all over your fingers. My Advice: If you stop touching Patty's penis, your hands will stay clean and you can type like a normal human.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Regardless, the context of the message seems to be that you expect your lad Patricia to drink like a madman on Banquet Night and drive Artie into the ground.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2 Reasons this conversation is kind of amusing::</P>
<P>1) Art was never one of the big drinkers in the house, compared to those around him. That's not to say he didn't have his nights, but no one would have been particularly stressed about outdrinking him. 2) And yet, I really don't doubt that Art can handle you two!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And here's the kind of sad note - every message I've heard from you pledges talking shit has been, essentially "Patty's gonna kick your ass." Well what about the rest of you? If we try to make you drink with us, are you going to run off to get your Mommy Patty to do your drinking for you?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When I was a pledge we drank, and we drank like, well, like pledges, which meant we drank all the time. Things were better then...</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>WHEN I WAS A JUNIOR, I passed out naked on a couch in a lounge at Baker, and people just accepted it. I was completely ignored by everyone until my girlfriend woke up and came across me on her way to class. Nobody called the CP's, the Med Center, or The Tech. </P>

<P>Subject: RE: The front page news</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Maybe this whole issue could be downplayed if TDC just started getting weekly columns in the Tech. You know, this week its passing out in Baker, next week it's "TDC Brother found unconscious face-down in his own vomit in Institute Bathroom" or " TDC's get naked at PBE party". It could be kind of like a weather report, maybe: "Big Party Friday - Mostly Shitty with 90% Chance of Naked Vomiting TDCs" or "Wasted with Occasional Trippers"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Eventually other people at MIT would develop the same tolerance that people at the house have for this kind of behavior. I think it could really help the whole community grow together.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Well, if nothing else, just think about all the shit people have done that HASN'T been reported in the Tech.</P>

<P>I can't believe that Jesse did not take the opportunity to strip nekkid before he disposed of his body under that table. I find it uniquely dissapointing that the tech didn't go all the way. You know my theory, if your gonna lie GO ALL THE WAY The article should have said something like:</P>
<P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>Crazed naked, drunk, cracked out, partying like a "rockstar" TDC brother; found under table at Baker with the keys to the White House, a plutonium bomb, 12kg of cocaine and two Russian mail order brides. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Campus Police chief Anne Glavin states, "I don't know what the fucking kid was on but it must have been some strong shit".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>State Police were brought in when the TDC brother, disturbed by the CP's, woke up and in a smack induced haze ran out from under the table leapt(thats right leapt) onto a Mass Avenue bus and stuffed the driver John Gesmundo III out the side window of the bus; seizing control of the bus.</P>
<P>The perpetrator who is so obviously guilty that he should be denied due process and sent to a Siberian Death Camp; then proceeded to drive the bus, at its top speed of two hundred and twenty miles per hour, directly into the Charles River. Jesse Geraci, TDC brother, was then captured after a 24 hour manhunt in Bumblefuck Oregon screwing alumni Mike Tovino '92 in the ass.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The president of TDC, Camilo Cepeda who was questioned said, "Look I don't why they did this. These young guys, there different than we were, they are fucking animals, they don't know right from wrong. I think it the internet that makes them crazy. The find all sorts of stuff there , like these online head-shops and nasty pornography. I just want to graduate, and get the hell out of here. Sometimes I fear for my life..."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The driver, Mr. Gesmundo III, was bruised and battered from hitting the black top while the bus was in motion but otherwise unhurt. He was taken to MIT medical center where in an effort to stop his cranial bleeding the med-center doctors stitched his asshole shut; Mr. Gesmundo died later that night complaining of stomach pains, med center doctors could not find the cause. Mr. Gesmundo leaves behind 45 children and seven wives.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Other fraternities declined to comment fearing reprisal from the great and almighty director of the IFC Neal Dorrow. Mr. Dorrow,known affectionately to his friends and enemies as "Dr. Demento", claims that he was at home, quietly masturbating to Disney video tapes and in an unprecedented interview admitted, "That I have no clue what the hell is going on, I never did and I never will."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Chuck Vest addressed the school this morning, calling for"... an intelligent, committee driven forum combining the reengineering team, the students and the faculty. We all need work together to resolve the terrible trauma and raise some goddamn money from these worthless cheap ass alums, oh my I'm sorry was I thinking out loud..."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The actions of the brother from TDC were completely thoughtless. He did not think about the safety of his fellow students or the effect his wanton drunkenness would have on our circulation. Incidentally um, a Jesse while what you did was um, filthy and gross and like we abhor drinking, could you do it again so a lot of people will read our shitty worthless, drivel rag? &#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Faithfully Submitted,</P>

<P>Subject: Jobs for sale... who wants 'em?</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>OK, the Marketing Research firm I work for, is looking to hire a computer nerd.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Said nerd should be able to program in C - or really any other language that creates effective Win95 programs. Also, a knowledge of networks in general - more specifically Windows 95, Windows NT, and Novell. Mac nerds need not apply.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Basically, we have a few scattered offices that we want to connect and organize. "One of them-there 'Intranet' things like what Ah was readin' 'bout in Fortune magazine", as our not so computer savvy leaders here might say. They want to be able to access files from all locations, and do so not just by project, but possibly by document type (like "proposal"), or other characteristics.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We are planning to get a "56 Kilo-byte line" that would apparently make us authentic Internet people. We'd need someone to make this thingie operate our web site, handle our mail, and provide Netscape access so we can download dirty movies when things are slow at work. Also, we like to do funky manipulations with our data to make us look cool - this is the consulting aspect of our work - and it really would help if we had someone write programs so we wouldn't have to do anything hard. Like think. In fact, if you could write programs to make everything completely idiot-proof, I am confident everyone below the "Project Director" level would be fired and replaced by cheap immigrant labor, perhaps young Honduran children. This is the C programming aspect I referred to above.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I don't know about you, but this doesn't sound like a job that requires a full-time person. However, we will hire someone if they can make it sound like a lot of work, and if they smell good and are suave and de-boner enough that they could do consulting at times. On the other hand, if you think you can handle this in your spare time, we can pay "competitive" hourly rates for your C programming time and systems consulting advice. Also, this option would allow you to "flex your time", which really means lie about your hours from home, as I'm sure you all know.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Guidelines: Well, right now I'm one of the top computer people here, so if you know me that should make it sound pretty easy. You do have to be competent, because I'll look bad if you aren't. I don't know about salary (for full-time) but if you make more than me I'll kill you mother-fucker. The work can probably be done from Boston or Westport (the Connecticut portion of New York City), and I am confident any of you could smooth your way into some free trips down here to NYC if you wanted to do most of the work from Boston.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Let me point out the upside for you:</P>
<P>1- "Intranet" looks good on your resume.</P>
<P>2- So does "Technology Manager", or whatever title you could make up for yourself.</P>
<P>3- If you know networking and programming, well, we don't, so you could be a genius (albeit among fools).</P>
<P>4- The competent person who takes this job will probably get paid more than they deserve, even if it's not THAT much.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My person requests:</P>
<P>1- Don't show up drunk or high, or request to be paid in drugs or alcohol.</P>
<P>2- Give me access to all the salary and profit-sharing information they keep hidden from me.</P>
<P>3- Convince them I need a CD-ROM Read/Write drive to be more productive 4- WHENEVER POSSIBLE, PROMOTE TELECOMMUTING</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seriously interested? Apply to me, Miles Kafka, at 202-2134@mcimail.com, and I will forward your resume to the appropriate person for a nominal processing fee of $5 (Yes, I'm that desperate). Or don't send the money, after all, I get paid from this end if they hire you.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanks, and this is for real,</P>
