<h2>Our House</h2>
<p>
Our five-story, waterfront mansion located on MIT campus offers the flexibility of living in Boston, the beauty of being on the Charles River, and the convenience of MIT’s free facilities and transportation nearby. Besides it’s great location, it’s clean, the brothers are fun, and the physical plant is amazing:
</p><p>
We’re equipped with a massive pub, a TV room with game consoles, a pool room, a grand piano, foosball tables, and amazing roof decks on every floor. We’ve also got a back yard where we’ll be having regular barbecues and a parking lot. The rooms are also furbished.
</p><p>
If you’re looking for somewhere you can live and party, then TDC’s for you. We’re looking for boarders that want to have a good time and won’t mind hanging out with the brothers on a regular basis. We will be throwing parties, BBQs, having beach trips, and organizing other social events throughout the summer.
</p><p>
We’ve got doubles, triples, quads, and even a few singles available—all with amazing views. Price varies by room size. Come check us out!
